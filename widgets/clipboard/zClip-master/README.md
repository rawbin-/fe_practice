# zClip

zClip is a lightweight jQuery "copy to clipboard" plugin built using the popular [ZeroClipboard][zeroclipboard] library. This plugin uses an invisible Adobe Flash movie that is fully compatible with Flash Player 10 and below.

## Fork
This is a fork of the original [zClip][zclip] library to support using newer versions of the ZeroClipboard library, allowing an upgrade path away from the XSS vulnerabilities. I'm following semvar and this library matches the API of the original.
